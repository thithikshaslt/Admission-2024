                                Choosing M.Sc. Fashion Designing and Merchandising is one of the best decisions of my
                                life. Though, initially I was skeptical about the course, since,
                                we were the first batch and I wasn’t into designing, day by day, year by year, it
                                proved me wrong because FDM is more than just a normal designing course.
                                It is a carefully put together cusp of production, designing and management by
                                experts¬¬¬¬. We have an amazing panel of faculties from whom we learn so
                                much more than just the curriculum, including, time management, professionalism,
                                leadership, inter-personal skills, all of which are crucial for both
                                professional and personal growth. We have industrial visits, cluster visits, complete
                                internship in two semesters (seventh and tenth to be precise) all
                                of which mould us into professional individuals by honing the key skills required by
                                the industries. Overall, it’s a blue-chip course designed to not
                                only teach everything you need to know but lead you in the right direction to be able
                                to succeed. Altogether the complete learning’s from the course made
                                to strive as an successful entrepreneur now.

                                 I was a person who did   not have any idea about my career after schooling. I got my

                                  the turning point that happened in my life. 5 years of my college life taught me
                                  to manage all my responsibilities and still make time for the things I enjoy. The
                                  courses taught me in M.Sc FDM helped me to grow into a more confident person. I 
                                  have learned to trust my own judgment and to stand up for myself when necessary.
                                  The main reason behind this is the selfless faculty who put all their efforts
                                  in sowing the seeds of knowledge which became a tree with strong roots. I am

                                yet the fear of studying 5 years straight in a row kept me petrified. But it turned
                                out to be the place
                                where I understood myself and learnt some life lessons, enriched by the constant
                                guidance that was provided
                                with efficient training. The department of Apparel and Fashion Design has nourished me
                                with great knowledge
                                by the supporting faculties and immense fun with my energetic peers. This college and
                                the department has
                                provided us the platform to build our character by enhancing our leadership and
                                negotiation skills through
                                various forum activities and events. It has the best curriculum that involves not just
                                theoretical lectures
                                but a lot of experimental and explorative opportunities to make learning more
                                interesting, as well as to connect
                                with new personalities which definitely will help groom one's future. This sure has
                                been the amazing 5 years in my
                                life and I owe a lot to PSG College of Technology for who I am today.

                                I have always wanted to be the best and so I chose to learn from the best. But when I
                                entered PSG Tech, I was shocked.
                                Guess what, it had more than what I expected. It was a great experience for me
                                studying here. You laugh, you cry, you
                                learn and you win. That’s exactly what happens here. All the faculties have been so
                                friendly and keen on bringing out the
                                talents from the fellow students. The five years at PSG Tech helped me to realise my
                                skills and nourish them. Especially
                                I’ve created a good network with lots of personalities which are really important in
                                one’s life.

                          My experience at PSG College of Technology was instrumental in paving the way for me to 
                          launch my own brand. The education I received there wasn't just about textbooks and
                           lectures—it was an immersive journey that prepared me for the real-world challenges of 
                           entrepreneurship. From day one, The AFD department fostered an environment of innovation 
                           and excellence. The curriculum wasn't just theoretical; it was practical and hands-on, 
                           giving me the skills and knowledge I needed to succeed in the competitive world of 
                           business. The faculty were more than just teachers; they were mentors who guided me every
                            step of the way. Their expertise and real-world experience were invaluable as I 
                            navigated the complexities of starting my own brand. Moreover, the college provided a 
                            range of resources and opportunities for budding entrepreneurs. Whether it was through 
                            workshops, networking events, or access to cutting-edge facilities, institutions offered
                            the support I needed to turn my ideas into reality. Perhaps most importantly, PSG 
                            instilled in me a sense of confidence and resilience. Through projects, internships, and
                            industry collaborations, I learned to tackle challenges head-on and adapt to changing
                             circumstances—a skill that has been crucial in my entrepreneurial journey. As I look
                              back on my time at PSG College of Technology, I'm filled with gratitude for the role 
                              it played in shaping my entrepreneurial path. The education and support I received 
                              there have been invaluable assets as I continue to grow and expand my brand.
